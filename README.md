**PLOT**
The Straw Hat Pirates come to Delta Island for the Pirate Fest, a large pirate gathering organized by Buena Festa. Festa sends the pirates to a floating island to hunt for a treasure that belonged to the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. The Straw Hats and many other pirate crews, including those from the Worst Generation as well as other past allies and enemies, set sail on a Knock Up Stream and battle each other as they race toward the treasure. However, this event is secretly set up as part of a plan between Festa and legendary pirate Douglas Bullet, who had been in the great prison Impel Down for two decades until being freed two years ago. Trafalgar Law discovers this and is attacked, but escapes onto the Thousand Sunny and warns the Straw Hats. Robin, Sanji, Chopper and Brook go with him to investigate, followed by the undercover Smoker. After sneaking into Festa's hideout, they discover that he has conspired with the Marines to send a Buster Call on Delta Island, which would destroy it and everyone on it.

As the treasure is found, a ship arrives and destroys the floating island. The pirates fall into the bay below, where Bullet takes the treasure and challenges the members of the Worst Generation to a fight. Luffy and the other Worst Generation members are quickly overwhelmed by his strength and Clank-Clank Fruit powers. He attempts to kill Luffy, but Usopp distracts him, causing Bullet to attack him instead. Meanwhile, the other pirates attempt to flee from Delta Island, but find the Marine Buster Call fleet headed toward them. As the pirates fight the Marines, Law's group encounters Smoker in Festa's lair, and Sanji battles him while Law and Robin escape. Sanji reveals to Smoker that Festa arranged for a Buster Call to arrive; Smoker was unaware and realizes that the Marines were set up. Meanwhile, Law and Robin run into the former Warlord Crocodile, who wants to involve Law in a plan. Bullet confronts the Buster Call fleet and reveals his awakened Devil Fruit powers, destroying the fleet and the town around him and forming it into a gigantic colossus, with which he overwhelms the pirates and Marines.

Festa reveals that the treasure in Bullet's possession is an Eternal Pose that can guide ships to Laugh Tale, the location of the most famous treasure One Piece. Bullet's dream is to become Pirate King by defeating the world's strongest people, and Festa intends to use his warpath and treasure to start a new era. After hearing of Bullet's actions, Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki orders a second Buster Call to attack the island. Sanji, Robin, Chopper, and Brook meet up, and the former two attempt to find a way to escape the island while the latter two look for Luffy. Chopper and Brook find Luffy and Usopp half dead, and Chopper treats them. After regaining consciousness, Luffy sets off to attack Bullet, but is overwhelmed. The Warlord Boa Hancock attempts to find Luffy, and she does so while running into Buggy, Smoker, Law, and Sabo in the process. Law shares his plan to defeat Bullet by tearing apart his colossus, and Crocodile as well as a lurking Rob Lucci join them. Their combined attacks destroy one of its arms, and Luffy destroys the other one with Gear Fourth.

Shots fired by Usopp then destroy the rest of the colossus. Luffy and Bullet engage in a fistfight, and Luffy defeats him. Crocodile and Lucci attempt to obtain the Eternal Pose, but Luffy destroys it, claiming he will find the One Piece with his crew without help. Festa mourns the failure of his plans, and is defeated and captured by Sabo. Luffy reunites with his crew and they attempt to escape along with the other pirates, but are confronted by the second Buster Call fleet. However, Smoker contacts his superiors to say there is no longer a need for the Buster Call, and Sabo helps the pirates pass through the fleet safely with his abilities. It is revealed that Roger disapproved of the Eternal Pose and threw it away, believing that the One Piece could not be obtained by someone who would rely on it. Luffy's crew is shocked that he destroyed the Eternal Pose, except for Usopp. Luffy claims that if that they had taken it, they would have missed out on many great adventures.
